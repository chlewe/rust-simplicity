//! # Simplicity jets
//!
//! [`Application`]s extend Simplicity by [`JetNode`]s, i.e., special nodes that read a value,
//! process it internally, and write an output value.  This jet evaluation happens in a black-box
//! manner:  In terms of the Bit Machine, it is a one-step process.
//!
//! In practice, jets call foreign C code that is equivalent to some Simplicity DAG.
//! This speeds up evaluation tremendously.
//! Equivalence of C and Simplicity is proved using the _Verified Software Toolchain_.
